Title: Marvel Merchandise Ecommerce Store.

Brand Name: Mad Over Marvel

The aim of the project was to build a marvel merchandise e-commerce store using the concepts that were taught during the training session. For the frontend, I have used React JS, for the backend Spring Boot and PostgreSQL was also used for database. 

I have named my brand as Mad Over Marvel. There are 2 types of people in the world: One, who like marvel, the other who don't and the ones that like Marvel are Crazy over Marvel and would love to get their hands over anything Marvel and hence I feel like naming the brand seemed very apt. The logo I have chosen is rather a simple one but it pays homage to one of the nicest human beings to grace this earth, Chadwick Boseman. Chadwick portrayed Black Panther perfectly and we will dearly misss him as the Black Panther. So, choosing the purple color os our brand logo would be a small tribute to the King T'Challa of Wakanda. 

Technologies and concepts used in the project:
React basics, CSS, Bootstrsap, React Routers, JWT Authentication, API calls, DB Connections.
